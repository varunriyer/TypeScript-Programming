# TypeScript-Programming

## Overview

This repository contains structured practice and examples for mastering TypeScript programming. It emphasizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using TypeScript, exploring types, interfaces, class structures, decorators, and error handling. The project also covers file handling and coding standards, essential for building maintainable and robust TypeScript applications.

## Topics Covered

### Core TypeScript Concepts

- **Types**: Understanding TypeScript's static typing system including primitives, union, intersection, literal, and custom types.
- **Classes**: Defining and using classes with properties, methods, and constructors.
- **Interfaces**: Contract-based programming using interfaces for type safety and code structure.
- **Access Modifiers**: Controlling access to class members using `public`, `private`, and `protected`.

### Advanced OOP and TypeScript Features

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction in TypeScript.
- **Decorators**: Meta-programming in TypeScript using class, method, and property decorators for extending functionality.
- **Exception Handling**: Structured `try-catch-finally` blocks for runtime error management.

### Practical Development Tools

- **Logging**: Implementing custom or built-in logging mechanisms for debugging and application monitoring.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files using TypeScript with Node.js integration.
- **Source Control Management**: Following best practices with Git and GitHub including commit structuring, branching, and version tracking.

### Coding Standards and Best Practices

- **Code Formatting**: Enforcing consistent formatting using linters and formatters like ESLint and Prettier.
- **Modularity**: Writing reusable and maintainable modules using imports and exports.
- **Strong Typing**: Leveraging TypeScriptâ€™s type system to reduce runtime errors and improve code reliability.
